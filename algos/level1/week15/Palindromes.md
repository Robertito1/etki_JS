### PALINDROMES

#### Directions
  Given a string, return true if the string is a palindrome or false if it is not. Palindromes are strings that form the same word if it is reversed. *Do* include spaces and punctuation in determining if the string is a palindrome.


#### Examples
  palindrome("abba") === true
  palindrome("abcdefg") === false
