### CIRCULAR LIST

#### Instructions: 

Given a linked list, return true if list is circular, false if it is not. 
As mentioned in earlier exercises, linked list has a head, which is the first node and a tail, which returns to a value of null.
A list is a circular when there is no tail node and the last node points out an earlier node within the linked list isntead to a value of null.


#### Examples 
````
const l = new List();
//   const a = new Node('a');
//   const b = new Node('b');
//   const c = new Node('c');
//   l.head = a;
//   a.next = b;
//   b.next = c;
//   c.next = b;
//   circular(l) // true
